# Linked List

- The sequence of nodes that are connected to each other are called *Linked List*.
- Linked List Types:
  1. Singly: refers to the number of references the node has.
  2. Doubly: refers to there being two (double) references within the node.
- Nodes have property such as next, which contains the reference to the next node, and Nodes have head, which a reference of type node.
- Also they have previous property, which contains the reference to the previous node, and it has tail.
- Linked Lists are linear data structures, so there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed. 
- The difference between arrays and linked lists is the use of memory.
- When an array is created, it needs a certain amount of memory and single block, while linked lists don’t need to take up a single block of memory.
- A circular linked list is a little odd in that it doesn’t end with a node pointing to a null value.
- Big O is a function related to the time or performance.
- A linked list is usually efficient when it comes to adding and removing most elements, but can be very slow to search and find a single element.
