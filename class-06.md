# Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

- Classes are created to hold all mutual attributes and then objects are created.
- The objects will be instances from the original class.
- All child classes are inherited from the parent class.
- To hide certain details and only show the important details of an object, interfaces are used. 
- ***Package***: is a group of similar types of classes and interfaces.
