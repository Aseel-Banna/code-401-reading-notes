# Java Primitives versus Objects

- Primitives Datatype in Java:
  - int: 32-bit
  - boolean: 1-bit
  - short: 16-bit
  - long: 64-bit
  - byte: 8-bit
  - char: 16-bit
  - float: 32-bit
  - double: 64-bit
- Arrays of the primitive types long and double consume more memory than their wrapper classes Long and Double.
- The performance of a Java code depends on the hardware that it is running on.
- The default value is null for the wrapper classes.
