# Android Fundamentals

* Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages.
* APK is an Android package that archives file with an .apk suffix that will be used with Android SDK to compile the code.
* One APK file contains all the contents of an Android app and is the file that Android-powered devices use to install the app.
* There is a security sandbox for each Android app that is protected by:
  * The Android operating system
  * Permissions that the system sets for all the files in an app so that only the user ID assigned to that app can access them.
  * Virtual machine (VM).
* The Android system implements the principle of least privilege: 
  * Each app, by default, has access only to the components that it requires to do its work and no more.
  * This creates a very secure environment in which an app cannot access parts of the system for which it is not given permission.
  * However, there are ways for an app to share data with other apps and for an app to access system services:
     * It's possible to arrange for two apps to share the same Linux user ID, in which case they are able to access each other's files. 
     * An app can request permission to access device data such as the device's location, camera, and Bluetooth connection.
* There are four different types of app components:
  * Activities: are the entry point for interacting with the user
  An activity facilitates the following key interactions between system and app:
    * Keeping track of what the user currently cares about (what is on screen) to ensure that the system keeps running the process that is hosting the activity.
    * Knowing that previously used processes contain things the user may return to (stopped activities), and thus more highly prioritize keeping those processes around.
    * Helping the app handle having its process killed so the user can return to activities with their previous state restored.
    * Providing a way for apps to implement user flows between each other, and for the system to coordinate these flows.
  * Services: are the component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations or to perform work for remote processes.
  * Broadcast receivers: are the component that enables the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user flow, allowing the app to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements. 
  * Content providers: manage a shared set of app data that you can store in the file system, in a SQLite database, on the web, or on any other persistent storage location that your app can access. 

* Android apps don't have a single entry point (there's no main() function). 
* Because the system runs each app in a separate process with file permissions that restrict access to other apps, your app cannot directly activate a component from another app.
* An intent is created with an Intent object, which defines a message to activate either a specific component (explicit intent) or a specific type of component (implicit intent).
* For broadcast receivers, the intent simply defines the announcement being broadcast. For example, a broadcast to indicate the device battery is low includes only a known action string that indicates battery is low.
* You can start an activity or give it something new to do by passing an Intent to startActivity() or startActivityForResult()
* You can use the JobScheduler class to schedule actions. 
* You can initiate a broadcast by passing an Intent to methods such as sendBroadcast(), sendOrderedBroadcast(), or sendStickyBroadcast().
* You can perform a query to a content provider by calling query() on a ContentResolver.

* AndroidManifest.xml can be used to:
  * Identify any user permissions the app requires, such as Internet access or read-access to the user's contacts.
  * Declare the minimum API Level required by the app, based on which APIs the app uses.
  * Declare hardware and software features used or required by the app, such as a camera, bluetooth services, or a multitouch screen.
  * Declare API libraries the app needs to be linked against (other than the Android framework APIs), such as the Google Maps library.

* An Android app is composed of more than just codeâ€”it requires resources that are separate from the source code, such as images, audio files, and anything relating to the visual presentation of the app. 
* For every resource that you include in your Android project, the SDK build tools define a unique integer ID, which you can use to reference the resource from your app code or from other resources defined in XML.
* One of the most important aspects of providing resources separate from your source code is the ability to provide alternative resources for different device configurations.
* The qualifier is a short string that you include in the name of your resource directories in order to define the device configuration for which those resources should be used.
