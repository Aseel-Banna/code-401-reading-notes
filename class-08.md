# OO Design 

## SOLID: The First 5 Principles of Object Oriented Design
- SOLID stands for:

S - Single-responsibility Principle
O - Open-closed Principle
L - Liskov Substitution Principle
I - Interface Segregation Principle
D - Dependency Inversion Principle

- SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin
- Single-Responsibility Principle(SRP):
***A class should only has one job to do.***
- Open-Closed Principle(OCP):
***A class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.***
- Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP):
***Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.***
- Interface Segregation Principle(ISP):
***A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.***
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
***Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.***
