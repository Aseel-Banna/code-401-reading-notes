Technologies are keeping update everyday. This amazing updating is done by people who spend most of their time to try and use different ways to make our live ease. But unfortunately, there are other people who use others work and steal it and provide a work without mentioning from where they get the idea or refer to the person who did the work. <br>

## The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of

Programming and coding is very useful department, and it is something related to talents and skills. Nowadays, programs, apps, websites, ...etc, they are a main part of our life. For me, the most beautiful part of it that what ever you think about it can be converted to a great idea of a website, app, ...etc. Because there is nothing impossible with coding! You can see that if you deliver something that solve a problem in your environment.

AI is the most difficult section in technology for me! It is very accurate. You can deal with machines and robots, which is something interesting and funny, but it is dangerous in the same time, since you will learn and teach machines by giving them training inputs and wait for their outputs. I know that is AI is the future, and it is beginning from now.
