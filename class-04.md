# Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

- Classes are created to hold all mutual attributes and then objects are created.
- The objects will be instances from the original class.
- All child classes are inherited from the parent class.
- To hide certain details and only show the important details of an object, interfaces are used. 
- ***Package***: is a group of similar types of classes and interfaces.

# Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers
- ***Decimal***: it is a numerical system that has base 10, and use numbers from [0-9].
- ***Binary***: it is a numerical system that has base 2, and use numbers from [0-1].
- ***Hexadecimal***: it is a numerical system that has base 16, and use numbers from [0-9] and [A-F].
- All the previous numerical system can be converted for each other using their weight from their positions.
- Select the base for the current numerical number and raise each position starting from right and to the power 0 and then multiply it with the digit that is in that position.
- At the end, make a summation operation for all digits to get the decimal number.
