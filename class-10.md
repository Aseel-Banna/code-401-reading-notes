# Stacks and Queues

The stack is a temporary memory that is built depending on data structure and it holds nodes that have references to the next and never have references for the previous.

#### Methods that can be used with stack

- Push - adding nodes to stack which will always be an O(1) operation and the pushed node will be the top and the top will be the next node.
- Pop - getting nodes from the stack which will be O(1) operation and popped node location will be the location for the next node before popping the node. 
- Top - the top of the stack
- Peek - view the value of the top Node in the stack which will be O(1) operation
- IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false and will be O(1) operation

### Concepts of Stack
- FILO ***First In Last Out***
The first item added in the stack will be the last item getting out of the stack.

- LIFO ***Last In First Out***
The last item added to the stack will be the first item getting out of the stack.

# Queue
Common terminology for a queue is:

* Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue, which will be O(1) operation
* Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue, which will be O(1) operation
* Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue, which will be O(1) operation
* Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue, which will be O(1) operation
* Peek - view the value of the front Node in the queue, which will be O(1) operation
* IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false, which will be O(1) operation

### Concepts of Queues
- FILO ***First In Last Out***
The first item added in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.

- LIFO ***Last In First Out***
The last item added to the queue will be the first item out of the queue.
