# Java Basics

- Variables: the names you give to computer memory locations which are used to store values in a computer program.
- Operators: symbols that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical, relational or logical operation and produce final result.
- Expression: a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations.
- Statements are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages.
- Block: a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed.
- Control Flow Statements: the statements inside your source files are generally executed from top to bottom.

## What does it mean to compile code?
- The code will be compiled before running to make sure that there are no syntax errors using a computer program called ***compiler***, that translates the code, which is written in a programming language, to a machine language, which is a language that the computer can understand, since the computer can only understand binary 0 & 1.
