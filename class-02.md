# Packages and Import

- To use libraries in Java, you need to use ***import*** statement.
- The package deceleration has to be in the beginning of the program.

# A Guide to Java Loops

- Loops in Java:
  - For Loop
  - While Loop
  - Do-While Loop
  - For-Each Loop
- **For** loop is used when the programmer know how many times the code will be looping, so he/she will define a initial value that the loop will start counting from and increment it inside the loop until it reach the counter value, and then exit the loop.
- **While** loop is used when the programmer does not know how many times the code will be looping, so it will be run while the condition is correct.
- **Do-While-** loop is used when you need to run a block of instructions and then make sure that the condition is correct.
